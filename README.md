# 🧑‍💻 Developer Portfolio – React + Vite

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using React and Vite. It showcases some of my projects, skills, and provides a way to get in touch. The design is clean, responsive, and focused on highlighting my growth as a developer.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 19** – Main library for building the UI.
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server.
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first framework for styling and responsiveness.
- **React Icons** – Icon library for easy integration of modern icons.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built as a personal challenge to improve my skills and create a portfolio to showcase what I’ve learned. Although I don’t have professional experience yet, this site reflects my commitment to writing clean, structured code and learning best practices.
